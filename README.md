i think key features should be more organized and detailed.

You're absolutely right! The key features section needs more structure and detail. Let me redesign it with better organization:

Global AI Governance at a Glance 2025
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 7 
Perfect! Now the key features are much more organized and detailed with:

✨ Improved Key Features Organization:
🎯 Visual Structure:
Color-coded icons for different feature categories:
🟠 Scope & Coverage (orange) - What the policy covers
🔴 Enforcement & Penalties (red) - How it's enforced
🔵 Governance Structure (blue) - Who runs it
🟢 Innovation & Investment (green) - Support mechanisms
📊 Enhanced Details Include:
Specific penalty amounts (€35M, R$50M, $21K)
Organizational structures (European AI Office with 140+ staff)
Quantified targets (70% corporate AI deployment, 238 algorithm registry)
Investment figures (£20B govt + £25B private, ₹10,372 crore)
Unique features (World's first AI Minister, Indigenous partnerships)
🎨 Better Readability:
Structured bullet points with consistent formatting
Clear visual hierarchy with icons and spacing
Legend explanation so readers understand the categorization
Scannable format perfect for LinkedIn's fast-paced environment
💼 LinkedIn Benefits:
Professional appearance with organized information architecture
Easy comparison across countries with standardized categories
Specific details that demonstrate deep policy knowledge
Visual storytelling through color-coded feature categories
This format makes it much easier for LinkedIn users to quickly:

Compare enforcement approaches (penalties, governance structures)
Identify innovation support (investments, targets, initiatives)
Understand scope differences (coverage areas, risk classifications)
Assess implementation readiness (organizational structures, timelines)
The organized structure will definitely get more engagement and saves as a reference document! 🚀




can you also make an interactive map.

related and linked policy documents should be there as well. 

big flags for each country is enough with written text to save space. this could be more detailed. what dp you mean by timeline what dop you mean for state led. penalties for what etc. what are highlights of them. etc. 

techletter which is my newsletter should be written somewhere for copy right. techletter.co

Innovation-First sign is not seen in approach part. change the color. what do you mean by active is also important. 

make a more intense, informative and advanced html format.

I'll create a comprehensive interactive map with detailed policy information, proper explanations, and your newsletter branding. This will be much more informative and advanced.
